# acoustic_impedance_infant_ear

Parametric model of young infants' eardrum and ear canal acoustic input impedances according to [^1] and [^2].

Provides matlab-code of an electro-acoustic model of the ear canal and the middle ear of young infants. It can be used to predict the acoustic input impedances of the ear canal and the eardrum either for the healthy ear, or for selected pathological middle ear conditions.

## Usage

Excamples how to use the model can be found in:

- [example_ear_canal_and_eardrum_impedance.m](example_ear_canal_and_eardrum_impedance.m)
